I was born in the state of Maine, and raised in the Catholic Church.   When I was around the age of 8 I went to "Camp Fair Haven" and there for the   first time I met my Lord and Savior. Later when I was about 12 my family grew   dissatisfied with our current denomination, because of some teachings that seemed   to conflict with the scriptures. As a family we decided to change denomination   and from then on attended a non-denominational church, very similar to the Evangelical   Free tradition. There we all grew in faith and followed the Lord together. </font></font></p><p><font size="3"><font color="#800000">It was in that church that I met my sweetheart   Nancy. We were both of the same age and both home schooled. After knowing each   other for a little more than a year we decided to actively pursue a relationship   with each other. Although now I laugh at some of the silly rules we made, and   steps we took, I can really see God's leading in our relationship keeping us   pure and building our friendship on a solid foundation. That was a long time   ago; now we are married and making our lives together and looking ahead to growing   old and gray side by side.</font></font></p><p><font size="3"><font color="#800000">Home schooled Christians are not very   common as scientists, but I strongly feel that the Lord has given me a talent   to learn, and blessed me with the opportunity for this calling. My goal is continue   to work hard wherever the Lord leads me, and hopefully earn advanced degree’s   that will allow me to teach and to do my own research. I sense an eventual call   to ministry of some sort, most likely later in life, but I'm leaving that up   to Him, and taking things one-step at a time.<br>  </font> </font></p><p><font size="3"><font color="#800000">In the middle of all of this I have many   hobbies that I pursue. These include fly-fishing, hunting, hiking, writing,   bonsai, web design, reading, and more. Most of these can be learned about on   this site.</font><br>  </font></p><p><font size="3"><font color="#800000">If you have questions about faith, Grove   City College (where I graduated), or molecular biology, drop me a note at losthawken50@netscape.net,   and I would be glad to share with you anything about my life.</font><br>  </font></p><p><font size="3"><font color="#800000">God Bless,</font></font></p><p><font size="3"><font color="#800000">Justin G.</font></font></p><font size="3"><br></font> </td></tr></table></body></html>
