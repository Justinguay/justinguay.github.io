When I revise it I'm going to add quite a bit more about the macrobes and some other details that will help with the plot exposition.&nbsp; Unfortunately many of the important details are still being worked out as the story is written.&nbsp; I've received a little feedback but not quite as much as I had hoped.&nbsp; Talking about the book helps motivate me to actually write it, so anything that you have to say or ask would be great.&nbsp; In fact, I think it would be interesting to hear where you think the book is going next before you get to read it.&nbsp; So please take a little time and<a href="mailto:losthawken50@netscape.net?subject=Overtone">Tell me</a>.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David woke at 7:00 AM on a       chilly winter morning.&nbsp; The apartment was dimly lit by the morning sun,       but David’s eyes were still cloudy with the remnants of sleep as he made       his way to the bathroom to get ready for work.</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A hot shower and a cup of coffee       refreshed his spirit soon enough, and David took a moment to read the book       he had received from Dr. Ketler.&nbsp; Now that he was out of the metaphysics       research facility he found that he had more time for such pleasantries.</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both he and Lucien had been returned       to their prior research projects for a much needed change of pace.&nbsp; The       metaphysics institute had decided that the heavy demands of the CAIN       research program would be too straining over time, and a furlough was       ordered.&nbsp; The men were quite glad to get an escape from the attention,       even if they still had to work at their old jobs.&nbsp; Fortunately no one       really knew what they had done during there many months of absence, and       most weren’t terribly concerned either, not being metaphysicists       themselves.</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David and Lucien had begun to maintain       a consistent correspondence, sharing their experiences with the CAIN       implants.&nbsp; One of the other goals of the furlough was to test and expand       each subject’s new analytical abilities in the practical applications of       the lab. </b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>To this aim the men       applied themselves readily.&nbsp; They were learning to see more and more with       the new insights that their implants gave them.&nbsp; Hurdles that had held       their projects up for months during their absence seemed simple to       overcome with the proper application of metaphysics.&nbsp; The men were met       with great success in every venture that they tried.</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>Of course careful tabs       were kept of each man by the metaphysics institute as well.&nbsp; Weekly       reports were sent in, and monthly exams were a requirement.&nbsp; Since David       and Lucien had first seen the anomaly in the medical center neurological       and psychological evaluations had become a must as well.</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>To both David and       Lucien’s surprise the anomaly that they had seen was not an unprecedented       event.&nbsp; There was even a name for the mathematical anomalies.&nbsp; The       aberrations in chaos had been labeled ‘Macrobes’ but their existence was       still heavily contested.&nbsp; </b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>Macrobes were first       postulated in the early years after metaphysics had become an established       science, although at the time the concept was not taken seriously.&nbsp; The       theory essentially postulated that the patterns of life were not limited       to the confines of biological matter.&nbsp; Even in biology it was seen that a       pattern was taken from its core medium, the DNA of the first embryonic       cell, and propagated into an alternate expression of the same original       pattern in a different medium, that of the adult organism.&nbsp; Pattern       propagation of this kind is seen in many areas. &nbsp;The pattern of words on a       page can be reflected as signals received by the eye and sent to the       brain, directed to the muscles of the mouth, and repeated again by means       of sound vibrations.&nbsp; Throughout each step the essence of the pattern       remains constant on the metaphysical level, even though its medium changes       several times.&nbsp; Nearly all things can carry information, sound, light,       even the movement of a branch in the wind as was seen by Lucien and David.       These concepts allowed for the possible existence of patterns capable of       propagating themselves through any kind of information carrying medium.&nbsp;      </b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>Unfortunately evidence       for the existence of such “self propagating patterns” was few and far       between.&nbsp; The few experiments designed to test for the existence of such       entities were successful in finding only hints and clues, but nothing that       could persuade the scientific community.&nbsp; Lucien and David experienced in       this criticism when their first reports of seeing a macrobe were met with       extensive neurological and psychological examinations.&nbsp; </b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>Fortunately the directors       of the metaphysics institute were of an open minded sort.&nbsp; Suggestions had       been made that the project should be terminated.&nbsp; Such a measure would       necessitate more dangerous surgery to remove the cybernetic implants which       could not longer be simply deactivated because of their artificial       intelligence self programming features.&nbsp; The decision was made by the       board, however, in light of the circumstantial evidence suggesting the       existence of macrobes, to continue the project.&nbsp; The compromise was that       there would be regular and in-depth examinations made for the safety of       both of the test subjects.&nbsp; </b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>David remembered how       tense some of those meetings had been.&nbsp; He certainly did not want to go       back under the knife remembering what had happened the last time.&nbsp;       Surprisingly though, the man whom he had come to recognize as the wisest       on the metaphysics research board, Dr. Ketler had remained gravely silent       and reflective during the meetings.&nbsp; He seemed deep in thought through       most of the meetings and didn’t have much to contribute.&nbsp; </b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>This was a disappointment       to David as he had hoped to get to know the Doctor better, and learn more       about this new way of thinking he had found in the medical center after       his surgery.&nbsp; David remembered well his experiences after the implant       surgery, and after talking with Dr. Ketler the distorted details of his       vision became much clearer.&nbsp; David wasn’t sure what to do with the ideas       that floated around in his head; all he knew was that he could no longer       avoid the question of ultimate reality.&nbsp; Dr. Ketler’s words by his       hospital bed and later the few conversations that they had shared amidst       their busy schedules confirmed the feelings he had been inwardly wrestling       with for so long, and provided a valid and believable philosophy to       explain them.</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>He knew that he now       believed in something, “There has to be a purpose,” he thought.&nbsp; But even       as he read the tattered old study book loaned to him by Dr. Ketler he       could not figure out what he should do about it.&nbsp; He wished that he could       have talked with Dr. Ketler to find the answers and ease the struggle in       his mind, but the older man had fallen ill and David didn’t want to bother       him.&nbsp; His mind was full of tension; he was excited and relieved to finally       have accepted that there was purpose and meaning to his life, and that       maybe even there was a creator somewhere looking down on him.&nbsp; But the       world seemed like such a cold place to any kind of firm belief much less a       theology.&nbsp;&nbsp; He couldn’t even share it with his best friend Lucien.&nbsp; His       heart was heavily burdened with the desire to talk about what he had       found, but fearful of what would result.</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>David closed the book and       ran his fingers through his short dark hair which had grown back some       since the surgery. &nbsp;&nbsp;He reminded himself that he had to get to work, and       that he needed to focus.&nbsp; “I have a big day ahead of me,” he said under       his breath.</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>David gathered his things       and made his way down to the company car he used to commute to the       Research Institute of Temporal Studies.&nbsp; It didn’t take him long to get       there, and once at work he found it easier to get his mind off of the       troubles and onto his work.&nbsp; Walking to his office, a young woman, one of       the assistants met him with a report of readings received from a recent       experiment.&nbsp; </b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>“The pod has been       overheating,” she said handing David a printout full of temperature       readings from a recent time dilation experiment as she continued, “I’m not       sure what the problem is.”</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>David looked at the print       out, the last few readings were way off scale for acceptable parameters.&nbsp;       Keeping the unit cool under the highly energetic environment required for       time dilation was one of the greatest struggles that the project was       facing.&nbsp; Looking at the page David began to scan through the numbers.&nbsp; As       he did his cybernetic implant silently went to work formulating       mathematical visions on the page for him.&nbsp; </b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>“It’s a valve,” he said.</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>“What?” asked his       co-worker, bewildered at his confident reply.</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>“A valve, see here,”       David pointed to the numbers on the page, “The temperature starts       fluctuating regularly after 220<sup>o</sup>, it’s a purely mechanical       failure.”</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>David handed the page       back to the astonished woman. &nbsp;“But how did you...” she stuttered as David       walked into his office.</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>David draped his grey       trench coat over the back of his chair.&nbsp; There was a letter on his desk.&nbsp;       He picked it up and found that it was from Lucien.&nbsp; “Good!” he thought, “I       haven’t heard from him in a few weeks now.”</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>Over the past few weeks,       he and Lucien had been conversing via letters.&nbsp; They had talked about new       ways they were finding uses for their CAIN implants, and different ways of       using them, but lately the correspondence had been mainly about the       macrobes.&nbsp; As their skills increased they began to see more and more of       them, and see how they were functioning in the environment around them.&nbsp;       It was unsettling to see how frequently they appeared in the chaos of       events and systems.&nbsp; It seemed that sometimes they even were affecting the       chaos and random events.</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>David opened the letter,       but before he was able to read an intern came asking for his assistance.&nbsp;       From there his day was off, first he assisted in locating the faulty valve       on the new temporal dilator, and redesigned a new one mathematically       in-tune with the needed function, and environment.</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>Soon after though, he had       to move on to his major task for the day.&nbsp; In his absence time dilation       had been advanced for enough to allow living things to undergo the       experience.&nbsp; However, because of the severe distortions created between       the “normal” time and expanded time, little information could be gained       from such experiments.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were still thought to be valuable regardless       of this fact because it was expected that time dilation was the first step       moving towards a sort of time travel.&nbsp; Having returned to find the       procedure refined enough for living organism, David had been curious, to       discover, what could be seen through the temporal distortion of the time       dilator with the aid of his cybernetic implant.&nbsp; He had sent out the       request forms immediately and after proving that the procedure was safe       and that the possible discoveries extremely valuable been approved to       undergo the procedure himself.</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>Now the time had come.&nbsp;       The experiment was to be preformed on the following day.&nbsp; In preparations       David examined the equipment to insure that it would function properly.&nbsp;       His CAIN device even helped with this as he was able to mathematically       estimate spring coefficients, tensile strength, and other properties that       had to be finely tuned for the procedure to work.&nbsp; He also had taken on       the task of ensuring that the pod carrying him was tuned exactly to his       own body, his weight, density, size, everything had to be taken into       account, but thanks again to his implant the process became as simple as       walking about and looking at the different components of the apparatus.</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>Finally at the end of the       long day David returned to his office to collect his things.&nbsp; He was       surprised to find himself nervous about the upcoming experiment.&nbsp; His       apprehension must be due to the last experiment he reasoned.&nbsp; David       reflected on his feelings of uneasiness before undergoing the surgery       grafting the chip into his brain, and the vision it had created as Dr.       Ketler spoke, while his life was hanging in the balance.&nbsp; So much had       changed since before that time, and there was so much to think about.</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>David looked down at his       desk and saw the half opened letter from Lucien.&nbsp; He pulled the letter out       and sat at his desk to read.</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>“Dear David,</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>Sorry for having not       gotten back to you sooner buddy, but there have been some very interesting       events here.&nbsp; The macrobes have become clearer and clearer to see, as you       know and have also experienced.&nbsp; I still find it ironic how the CAIN       interprets their mathematical forms as recognizable shapes and things from       this world, like the face we saw the first time.&nbsp; It’s funny how       metaphysics relates things together at from level of size and complexity.&nbsp;      </b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>David something       incredible happened, or almost happened and I had to tell you right away       so that you could be prepared if it happened to you as well. </b></p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>&nbsp;I have begun meditating       in order to focus when I encountered a macrobe.&nbsp; While doing this the       other this morning with a macrobe I encountered working in the underlying       patters given off by the radiator in my apartment (of all things!)       something different happened.&nbsp; Every macrobe encountered until now had       seemed to escape as soon as it was detected.&nbsp; This time it didn’t move.&nbsp;       The representation generated by my implant looked similar to a symbol I       had seen in a book.&nbsp; As I watched the macrobe faded and I thought it would       disappear, but then it returned unexpectedly.&nbsp; When it returned the second       time, something uncanny happened, the normal hisses and clangs of the old       radiator began to organize and then I heard it.&nbsp; “<i>amend</i>” it was       clear as day.&nbsp; The only problem is that I have no idea what it meant.&nbsp; </b>      </p>      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b>David, we had never       before considered it but what if these macrobes, these patterns within       patterns could be sentient.&nbsp;
